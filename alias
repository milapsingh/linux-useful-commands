As we know there are lots of commands in linux system. Sometime we need some commands repeatedly, so we can create our own command by ALIAS command.
Example: If we want to execute commands below many times so we can make an alias.
            1. cd /usr;
            2. ls
              Output: bin  games  include  lib  local  sbin  share  src
            3. cd ~
              Return back to home.
            We used 3 command for one work now we can make single command which will perform all the commands at once.
            -> alias my='cd /usr; ls; cd~'
            Now run command
               $:  my
               Output: bin  games  include  lib  local  sbin  share  src
                      and return back to home.
But by using this command these alias will destroy when you close your terminal.
